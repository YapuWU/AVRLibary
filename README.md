# AVRLibary

This library is trying to utilize the C++11 features to benefit AVR MCU development.
1. Use C++ to organize the libraries. Make the libraries easy to expand.
2. Try to keep the compiled binary as small as possible.

This library will include the following modules:
1. GPIO - Basic PORT and PIN operation
2. I2C - I2C protocol support
3. SPI - SPI protocol support
4. LCD - LCD display support(LCD1602 etc.)
